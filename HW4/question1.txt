The second part reads in each line, separates them by commas using split
then using map makes each value a 1 if its  a "" (blank,null) and 0 otherwise
then it adds them all up by line using reduce

It acheives the same thing because it is the same thing functionally, just different way
of getting there. It is counting 1 more than before for each blank in each line of the
csv with 0 being the base case
